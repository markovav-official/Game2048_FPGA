# Getting Started
Here is the step-by-step instruction, how to use our implementation:
1. Install Quartus Prime 20.1.1 and drivers
2. Go to our GitHub repository: Game2048_FPGA
3. Click on the button “Code” and then “Download ZIP”
4. Unpack downloaded archive
5. Open Quartus Prime 20.1.1.
6. Press “Open Project” and find the file “OptionalProject.qpf”
7. Choose your FPGA model in “Assignments” → “Device”
8. Go to “Assignments” → “Pin planner” and assign the following pins (only for Max10 Board):
9. Start compilation (around 15 minutes)
10. Connect your FPGA Board and go to “Programmer”, then press “Start”
11. Connect your Board to display using a VGA connector
12. Done! You can enjoy the “2048” Game!
